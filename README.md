# Cucumber Leaf Classification

## Project Description
This project focuses on classifying cucumber leaves into three categories: **Downy Mildew, Powdery Mildew, and Healthy**. It utilizes **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and **Transfer Learning** techniques to achieve accurate classification.

## Features
- **Custom CNN Model**: A deep learning model built from scratch for classification.
- **Transfer Learning Models**: Implements **DenseNet, InceptionV3, and VGG16** for enhanced accuracy.
- **Image Preprocessing**: Applies data augmentation, resizing, and normalization.
- **Model Training & Evaluation**: Trains models using preprocessed data and evaluates performance with accuracy and loss metrics.
- **Visualization**: Provides graphical analysis of training progress, including accuracy and loss curves.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV (for image processing)

## How It Works
1. Loads and preprocesses the dataset of cucumber leaf images.
2. Trains a **custom CNN model** and applies **transfer learning** with DenseNet, InceptionV3, and VGG16.
3. Fine-tunes the models for optimal performance.
4. Evaluates classification results and generates performance metrics.
