# Cucumber Leaf Classification

## Project Description
This project focuses on classifying cucumber leaves into three categories: **Downy Mildew, Powdery Mildew, and Healthy**. It utilizes **deep learning models** with **transfer learning** to achieve high accuracy in classification.

## Features
- **Transfer Learning Models**: Implements **DenseNet, InceptionV3, and VGG16**.
- **Image Preprocessing**: Applies data augmentation and normalization.
- **Model Training & Evaluation**: Uses pre-trained models fine-tuned for cucumber leaf classification.
- **Visualization**: Provides accuracy and loss plots for performance analysis.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV (for image processing)

## How It Works
1. Loads and preprocesses the dataset of cucumber leaf images.
2. Uses **transfer learning** with DenseNet, InceptionV3, and VGG16 for classification.
3. Fine-tunes the models to optimize accuracy.
4. Evaluates performance with accuracy and loss metrics.
